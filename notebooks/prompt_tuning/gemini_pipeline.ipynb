      "The candidate has 1 year of relevant sales experience, demonstrating strong communication, negotiation, and customer relationship building skills, which align well with the job's core responsibilities like onboarding store owners, managing sales, and building customer rapport. They also have experience in achieving sales targets. However, a significant drawback is the absence of any mention of a motorbike and driver's license, which is a stated requirement for this field sales position. The candidate's career goal leans towards Marketing, and their IT education is not directly relevant to this sales role.\n"
