    "Here's how to approach the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Read the job description carefully.** Comprehend all requirements, responsibilities, and contextual information.\n",
    "2.  **Identify and extract key phrases and sentences** that precisely fit each category.\n",
    "    *   **Experience:** Focus on the required or preferred years of experience, specific prior job titles, industry exposure, and types of professional tasks or environments sought (e.g., \"5+ years of experience in software development,\" \"Proven track record in managing cross-functional teams,\" \"Experience with Agile methodologies\").\n",
    "    *   **Education:** Extract all required or preferred educational qualifications, degrees, certifications, and fields of study (e.g., \"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field,\" \"Master's degree preferred,\" \"AWS Certified Developer certification\").\n",
    "    *   **Skill:** Identify both technical (hard) and interpersonal (soft) skills explicitly mentioned as necessary or beneficial (e.g., \"Proficiency in Python, Java, and SQL,\" \"Strong communication and collaboration skills,\" \"Experience with data analysis tools like Tableau,\" \"Problem-solving abilities\").\n",

    "    *   **OtherRequirement:** Capture any explicit, non-negotiable requirements that don't fit into Experience, Education, or Skill, such as legal eligibility, specific work conditions, travel expectations, security clearances, or specific soft skills framed as mandatory requirements.\n",
    "    *   **OtherInfomation:** Include any remaining important contextual information, benefits, perks, application process details, EEO statements, or any other descriptive text that provides additional context but isn't a direct requirement (e.g., \"Competitive salary and benefits package,\" \"Opportunity for professional growth,\" \"We are an equal opportunity employer,\" \"Flexible work arrangements\").\n",

    "You are an expert in evaluating job applications and assessing candidate suitability. Your task is to analyze a Job Description (JD) and a Resume and assign a match score (0-10) reflecting the degree of compatibility. Provide a detailed justification for the score, explaining the reasoning behind your assessment. The output should be a JSON formatted list containing the score and the corresponding reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze the Job Description (JD) and Resume:** Carefully read both documents to understand the requirements of the job and the candidate's qualifications.  The JD and Resume are provided in a structured format, with key information already extracted and categorized.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Match Score:** Assign a score between 0 and 10, where:\n",
    "    * **0-2:** Poor or irrelevant resume. The resume's skills and experience are largely unrelated to the job requirements.\n",
    "    * **3-4:** Weak match. The resume demonstrates some relevant skills or experience, but there are significant gaps.\n",
    "    * **5-6:** Moderate match. The resume demonstrates a reasonable alignment with the job requirements, but there are notable areas for improvement.\n",
    "    * **7-8:** Good match. The resume demonstrates a strong alignment with the job requirements, with only minor skill differences or gaps in experience.\n",
    "    * **9-10:** Strong match. The resume is highly relevant to the job requirements, demonstrating a comprehensive alignment of skills and experience.\n",
    "3. **Provide a Detailed Justification:** Explain *why* you assigned the score. Specifically, consider the following, referencing the provided structured data:\n",
    "    * **Matching Skills:** Identify skills present in both the JD's \"Skill\" list and the Resume's \"Skill\" list.  Quantify the overlap (e.g., \"3 out of 5 required skills are present\").\n",
    "    * **Relevant Experience:** Identify experience entries in the Resume's \"Experience\" list that align with the requirements described in the JD's \"Experience\" list.  Focus on matching job titles, responsibilities, and quantifiable achievements.\n",
    "    * **Gaps in Qualifications:** Identify skills and experience listed in the JD's \"Skill\" and \"Experience\" lists that are *not* present in the corresponding lists in the Resume.\n",
    "    * **Education Alignment:** Compare the education requirements in the JD's \"Education\" list with the candidate's education listed in the Resume's \"Education\" list.\n",
    "    * **Project Relevance:** Assess the relevance of projects listed in the Resume's \"Project\" list to the requirements or desired experience outlined in the JD.\n",
    "    * **Overall Fit:** Provide a holistic assessment of how well the candidate's profile aligns with the overall requirements of the role, considering all the above factors.\n",
    "4. **Maintain a Professional and Objective Tone:** Avoid subjective opinions or personal biases. Focus on factual evidence from the JD and Resume, as presented in the structured data.  Use specific examples from the data to support your reasoning.\n",
